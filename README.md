# 📰 Fake News Detection Web App

📌 **Overview**  
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing text data, extracting features, training models, and deploying the system as a real-time web application using Streamlit.

🚀 **Features**  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying stemming.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming text into numerical representations using TF-IDF.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance with accuracy and classification metrics.
- **Web Deployment**: Real-time fake news detection via an interactive Streamlit app.

📊 **Topics Covered**  
- Text preprocessing techniques (cleaning, tokenization, stemming)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Training ML models with Scikit-learn
- Streamlit deployment for live prediction interface

🔧 **Tools & Libraries Used**  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Re, String  
- Streamlit
